# Pressure Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Pressure Sensor project demonstrates how to utilize an Arduino Nano to interface with a pressure sensor, enabling the measurement and monitoring of pressure levels. Pressure sensors are vital components in various applications, including industrial automation, weather monitoring, and medical devices.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Pressure Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Pressure Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the output of the pressure sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Power the pressure sensor according to its specifications (usually with 5V and GND connections).

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the pressure sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display the pressure values read from the sensor.

#### Applications

- **Industrial Monitoring:** Monitor pressure levels in pneumatic systems, hydraulic systems, and pipelines.
- **Weather Stations:** Use pressure sensors to measure atmospheric pressure for weather forecasting.
- **Medical Devices:** Incorporate pressure sensors into medical equipment for monitoring blood pressure and respiratory function.

#### Notes

- Ensure that the pressure sensor is calibrated and configured correctly for accurate readings.
- Experiment with different pressure sensor models and ranges to suit specific application requirements.
- Consider implementing additional functionalities, such as threshold-based alerts or data logging, based on project needs.
